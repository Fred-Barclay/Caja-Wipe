Description: Caja Wipe Extension has been installed. You should restart caja to make it work properly (hint: 'caja -q' in terminal). Or, if you prefer, a session restart is more than sufficient. After the restart, a new option will emerge in the Caja context menu, allowing you to securely delete files.
